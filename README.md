# Roboflow
Roboflow integration with Gallica content

## General context
- Extraction of typographical material from the early prints of the RÃ©serve collections (BnF)
- Roboflow [project](https://app.roboflow.com/snooptypo)
- [Methodology](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TdVedZGo4_sOiXMk-Do7hSQA7STYTNOU_ZxO1fHRrXw/edit?slide=id.g12b1dcf850d_0_49#slide=id.g12b1dcf850d_0_49)


## 1. Extracting images from Gallica

Workflow:
1. Obtaining images of documents (Gallica IIIF API, extraction script).
2. Ingesting a subset of these documents into Roboflow for annotation.
3. Processing the rest of the corpus.

`extract_iiif.py` must be feed with a file of ARK IDs and a image ratio for extraction (> 0.0 and <= 1.0):

```
>python extract_iiif.py arks.txt 0.7
```
IIIF images are stored in a IIF_images folder, in subfolders named by ARK IDs.

## 2. Training a model with Roboflow
See this [tutorial](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-a0tdgQRa2K5ESwN5IhTn8VnGtDaxeseK37TgvtaiHY/edit?slide=id.g12b1dcf850d_0_49#slide=id.g12b1dcf850d_0_49)
and [methodology](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TdVedZGo4_sOiXMk-Do7hSQA7STYTNOU_ZxO1fHRrXw/edit?slide=id.g12b1dcf850d_0_49#slide=id.g12b1dcf850d_0_49)


## 3. Obtain annotations made in Roboflow

This step allows to get access to the annotated data but also to reuse it under the same conditions as the data produced later by inference.

Workflow:
1. Export the annotated dataset from Roboflow in COCO format.
In [Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com/snooptypo/snooptypo/models): 
- go to the Versions tab
- Click on the Download Dataset button
- Format: COCO, option: Download zip to computer
Note: The dataset must have been generated <i>without</i> augmentation in Roboflow, otherwise the same images will appear multiple times.
